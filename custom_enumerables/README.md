# Custom Enumerable Project

This repository complements the [Custom Enumerables Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-custom-enumerables) in the Ruby Course for The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to reimplement common methods used frequently through the enumerables module with objects like arrays and hashes.

### Methods

The following methods were created to test against the Ruby built-in enumerable methods.

- each : my_each
- each_with_index : my_each_with_index
- select : my_select
- all? : my_all?
- any? : my_any?
- none? : my_none?
- count : my_count
- map : my_map
- inject : my_inject

All the methods created passed against the built-in methods and produced the same result.
