# Linked Lists

In this project from The Odin Project, we were tasked with writing our own linked list data structure in Ruby. The purpose was to establish a foundation on which to build an understanding and utilization of data structures as they become more complex. 

The LinkedList class represents the full list, while the Node class represents each individual node being added to the list (and the respective next node pointer). Within the LinkedList class a group of methods were written to control input and output of the list, utilizing the Node class. 

## Methods

#append(value)
#prepend(value)
#size
#head
#tail
#at(index)
#pop
#contains?(value)
#find(value)
#to_s

Extra Credit: 

#insert_at(value, index)
#remove_at(index)
