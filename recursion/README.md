# The Odin Project: Ruby Recursion Project

This is a project section for The Odin Project's Ruby Programming course. The goal of this section is to practice solving problems using recursion. This project section includes two assignments that focus on practicing recursion in Ruby: Fibonacci and Merge Sort.

## Fibonacci

The Fibonacci Sequence is a well-known sequence of numbers that can be calculated recursively. The first assignment requires you to write two methods that generate a sequence of Fibonacci numbers: one using iteration and the other using recursion. The #fibs method should take a number as input and return an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. The #fibs_rec method should solve the same problem recursively.

## Merge Sort

The second assignment focuses on implementing the Merge Sort algorithm recursively to sort an array of numbers. The #merge_sort method should take an array as input and return a sorted array using the recursive merge sort methodology.
