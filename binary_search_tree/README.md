# Binary Search Tree Project

This project requires the implementation of a balanced binary search tree using the Node and Tree classes. The objective of this assignment is to learn importance of balancing trees, the benefits of using trees over arrays for certain operations, and the performance characteristics of different tree traversal methods.

## Methods

- #build_tree 
- #insert
- #delete
- #find
- #level_order 
- #inorder
- #preorder
- #postorder
- #height
- #depth
- #balanced?
- #rebalance

## Tie it all together

The goal here is to write a driver script that creates a binary search tree, confirm its balanced, print its elements in different orders, unbalance it, rebalance it, and confirm its balance again.
